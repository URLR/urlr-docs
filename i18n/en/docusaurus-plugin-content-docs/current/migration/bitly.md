## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please make sure you have the following :

- A Bitly account with access to the links you wish to migrate (Growth package or higher required)

## Links

### Export your links from Bitly

To export your links from Bitly, follow these steps :

#### 1. Log in to your Bitly account

Go to [bitly.com](https://bitly.com) and log in to your account.

#### 2. Export

Your Bitly links will be exported in the form of a CSV file. To generate it, you have two options :

- [Export all your links](#export-all-your-links)
- [Export a link group](#export-a-group-of-links)

##### Export all your links

You can export all your links:

- Click on **Links** in the left-hand sidebar
- Click on **Export**
- Enter your email address
- Go to your mailbox and open the e-mail sent by Bitly
- The file will then be downloaded automatically

##### Export a group of links

You can also select a group of links for export:

- Click on **Links** in the left-hand sidebar
- Select your links
- Click on **Export**
- The download will start automatically

#####Â CSV file

Next, you should have the CSV file. Three columns are important in this file:

- Link
- Custom Link
- Destination URL

These three columns will be used for the URLR import file.

### Import your links into URLR

Now that you have your CSV file, you can format it and import it into URLR. Help is available in [our documentation](imports/links.md).

## Statistics

### Export your statistics from Bitly

It is not possible to import your statistics into URLR. However, we advise you to **export your statistics and save them in case you need them**.
